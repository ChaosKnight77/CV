  <p><strong><em>Bodybuilding is a task that requires a lot of determination,
     hardwork and dedication</strong></em>. <em>It is not a path for the faint hearted
     or people who give up easily.</em> <a href="http://www.google.com"> If we look at what famous trainers and
     bodybuilders</a> have to say, bodybuilding is about 95% diet and 5% exercise.
     Now, this doesn't mean that you do not put emphasis on exercise and just
     look after your diet.<strong>This is just an analysis of the fact that if you work out like crazy but do not eat the
     adequate amount of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and fats, your body
     will never achieve it's full potential and you will just be disappointed
     with yourself.</strong>
